data-structures
===============

Sample code for a number of classic data structures.

##Authors

##Singly linked list - linked_list.py

##Stack - stack.py

##Queue - queue.py

##Doubly linked list - dll.py
Used http://python.dzone.com/articles/algorithm-week-linked-list as a guide for simplifying code in remove function.
Got an idea for a doubly linked list use case from https://community.oracle.com/message/10431517#10431517

As singly linked list might be appropriate as the basis of a stack, and a doubly linked list might be useful to keep a record of commands for undo/redo.

##Binary Heap - binheap.py

##Priority Queue - priorityq.py

##Simple parenthesis counter - parenthetics.py

##Simple Graph - graph.py

An implementation of a directional graph that has methods to return complete traversals, either depth-first or breadth-first.
